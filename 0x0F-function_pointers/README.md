#0x0F-function_pointers
This is the task on function pointers during the ALX SE programe.

## 0-print_name.c
Write a function that prints a name.

## 1-array_iterator.c
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

## 2-int_index.c
Write a function that searches for an integer.

## 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h
Write a program that performs simple operations.

3-calc.h
This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program. You can use this structure

3-op_functions.c
This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

3-get_op_func.c
This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.

3-main.c
This file should contain your main function only.

## 100-main_opcodes.c
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

### My thoughts
This was an interesting concept to learn
