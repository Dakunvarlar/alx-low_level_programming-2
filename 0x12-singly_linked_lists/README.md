# 0x12-singly_linked_lists
In this project we learn slingly linked lists as a data structure
A node  is a space allocated in memory that contains the data and the address of the next node.


## TASKS
## 0-print_list.c
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

## 1-list_len.c
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

## 2-add_node.c
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

## 3-add_node_end.c
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

## 4-free_list.c
Write a function that frees a list_t list.

## Advanced tasks
## 100-first.c
Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

## 101-hello_holberton.asm
Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

### My thoughts
Singly linked lists are similar to arrays one major difference i spotted is that data is not stored continuously in memory.
